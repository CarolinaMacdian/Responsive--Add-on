            <h3>Vila Real, a "Wonderful Kingdom!"</h3>
            <p>
              With over seven hundred years of existence, the city was once
              known as the "royal court of Trás-os-Montes" due to the high
              number of manors bearing coats of arms and family crests,
              attesting the presence of noble figures that established in the
              city by influence of the Marquis of Vila Real, the most powerful
              aristocratic house in Portugal, during the 16th and 17th
              centuries, after the Dukes of Braganza and the Dukes of Aveiro.
              Many of these family crests are still visible today in the manors
              spread throughout the old city and in the Carreira Garden.
